                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-2">As the virulent spread of the second wave of Covid infections continues
                        across the country, it becomes all the more imperative to get vaccinated as soon as possible, to gain
                        immunity against the deadly virus.</p>
                    <p>
                        Well, according to data from Bloomberg, at 20.94 lakh doses a day on an average (as on May 12), India
                        will take another 2.5 years to cover 75 per cent of the population. This is in stark contrast to the
                        time that advanced economies such as the US and the UK will take to reach there.
